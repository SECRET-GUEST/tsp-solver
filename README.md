# Introduction                            

Just playing with GPT-4 with solving random crypto algorithms such as **P = NP** or other cryptographic problems to rule the wolrdlrd in the sh4d0w. Don't thx me it's for the buzz lol^^<3

#  "Ant Colony Optimization" (ACO)

The scripts called "Ant Colony Optimization" (ACO) is an optimization method inspired by the behavior of ants when searching for a path between their colony and a food source. The algorithm uses pheromones to simulate the communication and exploration behavior of ants in nature.

There are 2 script one with a graphical representation the other with only the answer in a terminal.

# L-BFGS-B

There are 4 scripts, 2 using the google API to solve the TSP on google map, one with visual and the other faster with the answer in the terminal.

The L-BFGS-B algorithm is an optimization method used for solving nonlinear optimization problems with bound constraints. It is a variant of the Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm, which itself is a memory-efficient version of the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm. The BFGS algorithm is a popular Quasi-Newton optimization method used for finding local minima of smooth functions.

The L-BFGS-B algorithm is particularly useful when the number of variables in the optimization problem is large, and when some of the variables have constraints on their possible values. It approximates the inverse Hessian matrix using a limited amount of computer memory, which makes it more efficient for large-scale optimization problems.

The algorithm was developed by Ciyou Zhu, Richard Byrd, Jorge Nocedal, and Jose Luis Morales. You can find the original paper describing the L-BFGS-B algorithm here:
